# NYC-Subway-Data-Analysis
This project is a part of nanodegree program from udacity, In this project i will analyse NYC Subway Data and determine whether more people ride the subway when it's raining vs. when it's not.
The actual files scrapped from website is very large file, so i have't uploaded it.
U can use it by simply modifying location and file names.
Thank You.
