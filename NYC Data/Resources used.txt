Thanks for providing me an opportunity to make his project, this is my first project on big data(more specifically
data analysis) and in future I hope to make more such project.
I am listing down resources i had used in making this project:

1. Our mentor
2. Pandas official documentation pdf (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/pandas.pdf)
3. Matplotlib official documentation (https://matplotlib.org/Matplotlib.pdf)
4. Previous knowledge on mapper and reducer.
